# Javascript Notes



Javascript:

	- JS 
	- Jscript
	- LiveScript
	- ES
	- ECMAScript

Syntax is a term for -language-, so a syntax error is a mistake with the language/code written. 

With `var` you can overwrite the syntax,

`let` you can only modify the value

`const` is constant & can't be changed
